# VairÃ« Container Definitions

Home network container definitions and reverse proxy configuration, using rootless [Podman](https://podman.io) Quadlets.

## Services

* [Part-DB](https://docs.part-db.de/): Electronics and hardware component inventory tracking.
* [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/): Asset management and tracking.
* [Traefik](https://traefik.io/): Application proxy.

## Installation

_The assumed platform here is an Ubuntu 24.04 VM._

* Allow the services to access privileged ports by adding the following in `/etc/sysctl.d/user_priv_ports.conf`:
  ```
  net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
  ```
* Do the same for the active session by running:
  ```bash
  sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
  ```
  **TODO:** Revise this to instead use forwarding rules in the firewall and restore the privileged port threshold to
  1024.

* Symlink the various `*.container` and `*.network` files into `~/.config/containers/systemd`, and then run
  ```bash
  systemctl --user daemon-reload
  systemctl --user start partdb snipe traefik
  ```

* Ensure the services run even when the owner is not logged in by running
  ```bash
  loginctl enable-linger
  ```
